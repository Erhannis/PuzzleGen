UI
  Allow user to tweak grouping
  ^Allow command line usage?
Parameterize the min unassigned->spontaneous group size
Implement "min group size" and check
Multilayer
Generic layout constraints, check after each change?
On bad config, nuke small radius and regenerate it?
  Have to check constraints, could end up with bunch of tiny group fragments
DeLaunay triangulation
Hyperbolic geometry
Turn arbitrary edges into cells
  Remove whole-board cell
  ^Basic
Lindenmayer Systems
  Alter single-line systems, for making cells
    Take edge with same cell on both sides, turn one A and the other B, propagate until they collide?  Seed whole map, propagate between traces until collision?
  ^Generate
